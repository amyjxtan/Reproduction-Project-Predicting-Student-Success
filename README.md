# Reproducibility Project of Enhancement of E-Learning Student’s Performance Based on Ensemble Techniques by Alsulami et al. (2023, Electronics)
Amy Tan

## Project Overview

This project takes inspiration from the open science movement and consequently attempts to reproduce the results from the 2023 paper, [Enhancement of E-Learning Student’s Performance Based on Ensemble Techniques](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369489648_Enhancement_of_E-Learning_Student's_Performance_Based_on_Ensemble_Techniques) by Abdulkream A. Alsulami, Abdullah S. AL-Malaise AL-Ghamdi, & Mahmoud Ragab (2023, Electronics), which can also be found in the original_paper folder.


## Installation and Setup
### Codes and Resources Used

- **Editor Used:**  Anaconda
- **Python Version:** Python 3.11.5

- Full notebook and code can be found in the writeup folder

### Python Packages Used

- **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`
- **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `pyplot`
- **Machine Learning:** `sklearn`
  
## Data
### Source Data
The data used in this project is `xAPI-Edu-Data.csv`, initially downloaded from where the authors' originally uploaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data), saved into the variable `edu` in the Juypter Notebook. This csv is saved in the `data` folder.

### Cleaned Data
All categorical variables in the dataset were cleaned and transformed into corresponding numerical values to run subsequent classifier models - this dataframe is saved in the `data` folder under the name `edu_dummy` (and it stored under the same variable name in the notebook). The dictionary of cleaned/transformed variables is as follows for reference:
